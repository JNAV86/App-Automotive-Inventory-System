/*
 
 
 Write an inventory program for a used car lot.  
 
 You should have one Car parent class and child classes for 3 vehicle types 
 (convertible, SUV, Classic, etc).  
 
 The parent class should have 3 variables and 3 functions, 
 
 each child class should have 1 variable unique to it and 1 function.  
 
 Your program should allow the user to store up to 100 cars in the 
 
 inventory and write the cars out to a file when done.  
 
 Write your program in Word, notepad, wordpad, textedit, 
 Visual C++, eclipse, whatever you like and upload the result here.  
 I need the code, not a working program, no commenting is needed.  
 Remember the test will close when time is up and if you have not uploaded the file it will not count, 
 it is better to attach a 50% done program than nothing at all.
